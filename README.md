# Martian Token Crowdsale Challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to use Solidity to launch a crowdsale contract that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin. You will create a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant and that will be minted by using a Crowdsale contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.
